## Demo 

A demo of this project can be found at [https://videos-hooks.andrewrice.vercel.app/](https://videos-hooks.andrewrice.vercel.app/).

## Configuring the YouTube API

This application utilizes the YouTube Public API (V3). You will need to replace the YouTube API key in the `apis/youtube.js` file with your own key which can be generated in your [Google Developer Console](http://console.developers.google.com/). 

## Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
